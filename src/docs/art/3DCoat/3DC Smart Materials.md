3D Coat has their own website that you can download materials from [PBRLibrary](https://materials.3dcoat.com/scans)

Once you find a material you like download it <br/><br/>![Material Download Example Free](./img/MaterialDownloadFree.png)

# How to make a Smart material

You can make a Smart material from either images that you have made or from images from another website like [Texture Heaven](https://polyhaven.com/textures)

Once you have your images click on the + button in the Smart Material <br/><br/>![New Mat 1](./img/NewMat1.png)

This will open up a new window where you can add your images <br/><br/>![New Mat 2](./img/NewMat2.png)

If you want to add a condition for where the texture can show up, like on only edges you can select the option next to the place to put a condition map <br/><br/>![Condition](./img/NewMat3.png)

You can edit the condition with the Degree slider and Contrast
